# GEO AquaWatch Google Earth Engine Project

The goal of this project is to create global-scale, open access, freely available water quality information for inland and coastal waters to be used by multiple end users including the science community, water resource managers, industry and the general public. This work is a collaborative effort between the GEO AquaWatch community and Google Earth Engine. 

The assessment and monitoring of global coasts, lakes and rivers are crucial to our ability to understand the effects of environmental change on aquatic ecosystems and to model future change. However, given the large span of surface water (e.g. 117 million lakes) and with limited resources, water quality monitoring is quite challenging, if simply non-existent. Recent advances in satellite remote sensing, both in terms of sensor capabilities and associated algorithmic approaches now provide the opportunity to monitor essential surface water quality conditions from space.

Through developing and translating water quality algorithms into Earth Engine, we seek to broaden the useablity and transparency of remotely sensed water quality information. We hope this becomes a space to share work and learn from examples. 

All the work here should be considered in development. Use at your own risk.
